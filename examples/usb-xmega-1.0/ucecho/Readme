ucecho
------

This example is intended for ZTEX USB-XMEGA-Modules.

The firmware (defined in ucecho.c) declares Endpoint 2 and Endpoint 4
(both 512 bytes, double buffered, bulk transfer, belong to interface 0).
All data that is written to Endpoint 4 is converted to uppercase by
the ATxmega and can be read back from Endpoint 2.

This example does the same as the example in directory ../../all/ucecho
except that the uppercase - lowercase conversion is made by the XMEGA.

The driver (defined in UCEcho.java) uploads the the Firmwares ucecho.ihx
and avr/ucecho.ihx to the EZ-USB and the XMEGA Microcontroller, 
respectively, sends user string to the device and reads them back.

This example may serve a starting point for own projects.
